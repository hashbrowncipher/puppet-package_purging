Puppet::Type.newtype(:aptly_purge) do
  @doc = <<-EOD
Interfaces the Puppet package type with apt-mark, generating Puppet resources
in response.  Packages managed by Puppet are marked as manually installed,
those not managed by Puppet are marked as automatically installed.

The apt-get autoremover is then simulated, generating a list of packages to
be removed.  This type takes the resulting list and generates Puppet package
resources with ensure=>absent for any unmanaged resources that apt-get would
autoremove.

NOTE: This type writes into the apt-mark system, even when run in noop mode.
